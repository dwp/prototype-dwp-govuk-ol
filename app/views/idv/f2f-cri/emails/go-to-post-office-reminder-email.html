    <p>Dear Jane Doe,</p>

    <p>To finish proving your identity, you need to go to your chosen Post Office within the next 5 days.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What you need to take to the Post Office</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">When you go to the Post Office, make sure to take your:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Your chosen photo ID</li>
  <li>Post Office customer letter (you can find a link to download your letter in the confirmation email we sent you 5 days ago)</li>
</ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">At the Post Office</h3>

  <p>You'll need to show your Post Office customer letter on your phone or tablet, or take a printed copy with you.</p>

  <p>A member of Post Office staff will scan your photo ID and take a photo of you.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    You'll find details of your chosen Post Office in your customer letter. But you can go to any Post Office that offers in-branch verification: <a href="#" class="govuk-link">https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/in-branch-verification-service#bf-full-width</a>
  </p>

  <div class="govuk-inset-text govuk-!-margin-top-0 govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
    If you do not go to the Post Office within the next 5 days, you’ll need to start proving your identity again.
  </div>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">After you've been to the Post Office</h3>

  <p>We'll send you an email about the result of your identity check - usually within a day of going to the Post Office.</p>

  <p>You’ll need to follow the link in the email to sign in to your GOV.UK One Login and view your result.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you need help</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Contact the GOV.UK One Login support team: <a href="#" class="govuk-link">https://signin.account.gov.uk/contact-us</a>
