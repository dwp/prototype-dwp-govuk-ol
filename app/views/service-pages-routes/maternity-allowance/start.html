</ul>


<p class="govuk-body">You can get Maternity Allowance for up to 39 weeks and can claim after the 26th week of the pregnancy.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you delay sending your claim</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">If you claim later than 3 months after you want you Maternity Allowance to start, you may not get the full amount of Maternity Allowance.</p>
